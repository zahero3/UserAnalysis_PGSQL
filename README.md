This SQL script addresses several key questions related to user data analysis from a website perspective. 
It consists of seven distinct queries, each utilizing PostgreSQL features to extract valuable insights. 
The queries make extensive use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs), recursive CTEs, subqueries, and window functions such as LAG and RANK. 
These techniques provide an excellent foundation for both basic and intermediate SQL concepts, especially in the context of data reporting and analysis.
This script is designed to help users deepen their understanding of SQL, particularly when working with complex data sets in PostgreSQL.
